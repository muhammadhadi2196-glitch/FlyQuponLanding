Create a modern, high-end, mobile-first landing page for a coupon app called FlyQupon. The design should feel fun, energetic, and professional, with a foodie-inspired aesthetic (burgers, pizza, coffee, fries in the background). Use a color palette of green (savings, trust), yellow (energy, highlights), and white (clean background). Style it like UberEats or Doordash but with a playful coupon twist. The vibe should appeal to students, families, and everyday shoppers. The goal is to collect emails for early access and build hype.”
